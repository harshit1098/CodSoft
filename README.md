# CodSoft Data Science Internship Projects

This repository contains the machine learning projects I completed as part of my *Data Science Internship at CodSoft*.  
Each task helped me strengthen my understanding of data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and real-world problem solving using Python and machine learning libraries.
